# Predicting Wildfires
This project was created during the course "[Data Science Fundamentals](https://www.unisg.ch/en/studium/zulassungundanmeldung/zulzusatzausbildungen/dsf)" at the [University of St. Gallen](https://www.unisg.ch/en).<br/>
The goal was to predict wildfires in California US based on climate data.<br/>
The following people contributed to the project:
- Luca Inauen
- Jerom KÃ¤mpfer
- Yehudah Gol
- [Robin Scherrer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robin-scherrer)

## Instructions

1) Set the folder "DSF_Project" as your working directory

2) Run the files in DSF_Project/Code from 001 to 007. For 006 and 007, only run the 4th file (006_4).
The climateWeatherMetricData can be generated with the Webscraper as well.
Make sure the needed packages are installed. The wildfire dataset can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires).

3) The outputs of the scripts will be printed in .RData format to DSF_Project/Data. Every step generates its own output. 006 and 007 will generate plots in RStudio.

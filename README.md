# Predicting Wildfires
Predicting wildfires based on climate data

## Instructions

1) Set the folder "DSF_Project" as your working directory

2) Run the files in DSF_Project/Code from 001 to 007. For 006 and 007, only run the 4th file (006_4).
The climateWeatherMetricData can be generated with the Webscraper as well.
Make sure the needed packages are installed. The wildfire dataset can be downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires)

3) The outputs of the scripts will be printed in .RData format to DSF_Project/Data. Every step generates its own output. 006 and 007 will generate plots in RStudio.
